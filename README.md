# MSCS Project

This repository overviews an Artificial Intelligence design project which I completed while completing my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. The source code for this project is not publically available, in compliance with the Georgia Institute of Technology Academic Honor Code<sup><a href="https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/academic-honor-code">[1]</a></sup>.

Instead, I have substituted my raw code with a guided walkthrough of the project itself, the steps I went through to complete it, and the skills I acquired by solving it.

# AI Search

Search is an integral part of AI. It helps in problem solving across a wide variety of domains where a solution isnâ€™t immediately clear. I  implemented several graph search algorithms with the goal of optimally solving tri-directional search.
